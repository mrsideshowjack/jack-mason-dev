    <p>
      Hi, I’m Jack and I am full stack web developer currently working at IBM in London as part of the <a href="https://ibm-cio-london.github.io/studio-hiring/">CIO sub domain</a> working on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/public">PartnerWorld</a>; This is IBM’s largest microsite with tens of thousands of pages and users, with mixes of legacy and brand new code bases.
    </p>

    <p>
      I get to work on lots of exciting projects, and I am always seeking new skills and improving my existing ones. We make time in our sprints to spend time experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open source as well as going to tech meetups across London. 
    </p>

      I graduated from The University of Portsmouth in 2018, with a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in <a href="http://psd.docstore.port.ac.uk/C2187S.pdf">Web Technologies.</a>
